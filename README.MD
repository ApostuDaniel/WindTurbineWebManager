Wind Turbine Manager is a web application for managing wind turbines. A user can create an account, which can be later managed by changing the username, name, password etc. After creating the account, the user can create turbines in chosen location on a map provided by the Google Maps API. This provides the longitude and latitude for other APIs that provide real world data, such as weather conditions, wind speed, soil elevation etc. The suitability for creating a turbine at the chosen location is calculated based on this data. After choosing the location for creating a turbine, the user must specify a name, creation date and set the turbine to public or private. A public turbine will be visible to all the other users and available to purchase. The private turbines are visible only for the owner and they can see detailed data about them, such as the evolution of the wind speed and efficiency over time, the total energy produced etc. Those are calculated using real world data, provided by the APIs mentioned earlier. 
If a user purchases a turbine, a notification will be send to the owner, which he can accept and transfer the turbine to the buyer, or decline it. Extreme situations that damage the turbines, such as high wind speed, temperature, humidity etc. will be alerted to the user, which can choose to stop/start any turbine he owns.
